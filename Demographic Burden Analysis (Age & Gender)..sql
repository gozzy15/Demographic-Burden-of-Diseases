-- STEP 13: Interpretation guidance & next steps (comments)

/* Interpret results carefully:
   - Weighted shares (by pop_affected) better reflect the absolute burden.
   - Unweighted averages reflect the "typical" record but may be dominated by
     small-country or sparse reporting.
   - If many records had missing pop_affected, weighted metrics will ignore them.
   - Age buckets may be reported differently across sources â€” normalization helps,
     but definitions may still vary.
   - Gender field here is binary ('Male'/'Female'). If your data contains other values,
     adapt queries accordingly.

   Suggested next steps:
   1) Visualize top diseases by child burden (bar chart) and year trends (line chart).
   2) Drill down by country/region: compute country-level child burden for Malaria, etc.
   3) Combine with healthcare infrastructure (doctors_per_1000) to see if countries with
      more doctors have lower child shares for certain diseases.
   4) Export results for statistical testing in R/Python if you need formal hypothesis tests.
